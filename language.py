# Step 1: Read and parse the HTML file
with open("template.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as html_file:
    html_content = html_file.read()

# Step 2: Read the text document with variable replacements
with open("Lule√•swe.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as variables_file:
    variables = {}
    for line in variables_file:
        key, value = line.strip().split("|")
        variables[key] = value

# Step 3: Replace variables in the HTML content
for variable, value in variables.items():

    html_content = html_content.replace(f"*{variable}*", value)

# Step 4: Write the modified HTML content to a new HTML file
with open("output.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
